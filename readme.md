# [ffmprovisr](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr)

Repository of useful FFmpeg command lines for archivists! [AMIA hackday](http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Association_of_Moving_Image_Archivists_%26_Digital_Library_Federation_Hack_Day_2015) edition.

## What is this?

Project Objective: To facilitate better understanding of FFmpeg through collaborative sharing of useful scripts and detailed flag-level description of how each script works so archivists can copy-paste and produce their own scripts but also understand how and why they work.

## How do I see it?

Code stuff in the gh-pages branch. Readme is right here. The site is live and lives on github pages. You can see it [here](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr).

## How do I contribute?

You are welcome to edit the codebase yourself or just supply the information and ask it to be added to the site.

To contribute to this project directly (and more quickly), clone this repository and create a new branch (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`) and add or modify a new block in index.html. Then submit a pull request and someone can review and integrate your code. There is a commented-out sample available in index.html that can be used to build your own block.

If you are having trouble with the coding it yourself or with github knowledge, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/issues) with the kind of command you would like to see added to the site.
