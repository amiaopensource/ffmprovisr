# [ffmprovisr](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr)

Repository of useful FFmpeg command lines for archivists!

## What is this?

#### Project Objective

To facilitate better understanding of FFmpeg through collaborative sharing of useful scripts and detailed flag-level description of how each script works, so archivists can copy-paste and produce their own scripts, but also understand how and why they work.

## How do I see it?

The code is found in the gh-pages branch (the default primary branch). Readme is right here. You can see the site live on [GitHub pages](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr).

You can also install the latest [release](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/releases) on your computer with the command:
```
brew install amiaopensource/amiaos/ffmprovisr
```
and then call it locally with the command:
```
ffmprovisr
```
This works currently under macOS, Linux and the Linux subsystem on Windows. On classic Windows you can install the last [release](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/releases) manually and the open `index.html` in a browser.

## How do I contribute?

You are welcome to edit the codebase yourself, or just supply the information and ask it to be added to the site.

#### Edit codebase

To contribute to this project directly (and more quickly), clone this repository and create a new branch (`git checkout -b your-branch-name`) and add or modify a new block in `index.html`. Then [submit a pull request](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/pulls) and the maintainers will review and integrate your code. There is a commented-out sample block available at the bottom of `index.html` that can be as a guideline for your command.

#### Make a request

If you are having trouble with coding it yourself or with GitHub, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/issues) with the kind of command you would like to see added to the site.

#### General help

If you want to help but don't have a new script to add, you can help us by testing out the scripts available, by refining or clarifying the documentation, or [creating an issue](https://github.com/amiaopensource/ffmprovisr/issues) for anything that sounds confusing and requires clarification.
